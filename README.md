# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

I'm thrilled to share my latest project: an HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI! This dashboard is designed to provide in-depth insights into our key HR metrics, enabling more informed and strategic decision-making.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) featured in the dashboard include Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, and Average Age. These KPIs are crucial for understanding the workforce dynamics and identifying areas for improvement.

The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations to present the data effectively:

A Ribbon Chart that illustrates the number of employees by age, providing a clear view of our workforce demographics.
Stacked Bar Charts that display:
Average Monthly Income by Job Role, helping us understand compensation distribution across different positions.
Employee distribution by Education Level, highlighting the educational background of our workforce.
Attrition rates by Education Field, offering insights into how educational background correlates with employee retention.
Donut Charts that show:
Active Employees by Travel Status, giving a perspective on how travel requirements impact our workforce.
Department-wise Attrition, helping to identify departments with higher turnover rates.
A Matrix that presents Job Roles by Job Satisfaction Levels, providing a detailed view of employee satisfaction across different roles.
This comprehensive dashboard is a powerful tool for our HR team, enabling us to make data-driven decisions and optimize our HR strategies effectively. I am excited to see the positive impact this will have on our organizationâ€™s human resource management.
